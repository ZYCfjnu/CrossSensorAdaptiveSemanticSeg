# CrossSensorAdaptiveSemanticSeg
This is an implement of our work on Cross-Sensor Adaptive Semantic Segmentation for Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds Based on Continuous Potential Scene Surface Reconstruction. 


## Introduction:

In this work, we proposed a new point-level distribution alignment based on continuous potential scene surface reconstruction by using an implicit neural representation framework. This is a plug-and-play framework and can be used for different existing semantic segmentation backbones, e.g., the point cloud convolution-based KPConv, 3D sparse convolution-based MinkUNet, and transformer-based Point Transformer V3. This repo does not contain the source code of semantic segmentation backbones that can be found in other existing repos.
